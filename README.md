## Implementation of Bayesian notebooks
This repository is created for the purpose of understanding and practicing the concept in the book *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* by Cristopher Bishop.
It is built on top of an existing repository https://github.com/krasserm/bayesian-machine-learning, and it has some additional details such as including the basic function of
cosine and sigmoid as well as generating the dataset based on Gamma function. Most of the notation explaination has been provided by author krasserm above, and it only add some 
personal viewpoints on certain events.
